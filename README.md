# Mutual Aid


Welcome to Mutual Aid! This web app was built during the Winter 2021 quarter of Technology for Social Good, a class that aims to use software engineering to tackle social good. Mutual aid has been flourishing as a social good since the beginning of the pandemic and has often involved small local organizations that use Instagram to reach their audience. 

Dan had been helping out with Happy Valley Mutual Aid at the time and thought it would be great if there was a web application to help these communities out, and so began the idea of this web app. This app has a login system using Azure for verficiation, and features a ticketing system that allows a user to request and give mutual aid for anything they might need. Each ticket features a comment thread in case more information is needed.
